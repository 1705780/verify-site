# ContentCredentials.com Components

## Organization

We divide our components into several categories, which align with sections in Storybook:

- **Global** components are used across product offerings
- **Verify** components are only used in the Verify product
- **Apply** components are only used in the Apply product

## Internationalization

You can preview how components render different languages/locales by using the globe icon in the toolbar at the top of the page.
This will open up all of the languages we support.

## Accessibility

We run [Axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/) on all of our components to ensure they are accessible. You can see the results of the Axe
testing in the "Accessibility" tab in the bottom panel of Storybook.

## Designs

Please add links to the Figma designs in the stories where possible. This will allow people to easily see the original designs
from which the components are based in the "Design" tab.

## Why Storybook?

Storybook helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context.
That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing, or QA.

We recommend building UIs with a [**component-driven**](https://componentdriven.org) process starting with atomic components and ending with pages.
